## History

- 0.0.2 (23/06/2023)
  - Complete API for users and classes and implement frontend to use it
- 0.0.1 (19/06/2023)
  - Built basic route structure

<!-- ## Next Steps/Ideas

- Configure API routes for CRUD lessons (try PUT requests - who can edit?)
- Modal for adding/editing lessons + configure their appearance on screen (cards?)
- Improve appearance of lessons on page + responsiveness of dashboard
- See other todo apps for ideas on last two
- Edit class name and user details (ensure only owner of class can edit)
- Convert date from string to Date object and use calendar to input (date lib?)
- Correctly use date filters in sidebar to show specific lesons
- IF TIME:
- Have filters on top of class page to filter by week/half-term/term?
- OR: only see future lessons (button to filter past lessons)?
- Have a page for termly/yearly outline? -->
