## History

- 0.0.1 (19/06/2023)
  - Built basic route structure

<!-- ## Next Steps/Ideas

- Edit class name
- Modal for adding/editing lessons instead of inline
- Improve appearance of lessons on page (+ responsiveness)
- Convert date from string to Date object and use calendar to input
- Have filters on top of class list (e.g. "Today", "This week") to show specific lesons
- Have filters on top of class page to filter by week/half-term/term
- Split classes into half-termly/weekly subsections (have lessons in different arrays?)
- Or would it be better for classes to be just a list of names and lessons to be added into DB indivdually (and rendered through filtering?)
- Have a page with termly/yearly outline -->
