<!-- ## Next Steps/Ideas

- Use Redux for state mgmt or otherwise get page to reload when class changes
- Correctly use filters in sidebar to show specific lesons (third one: past lessons)
- Apply filters on class pages (e.g. by week, month, term, past) and reverse sort?
- Add icons to menu options and forms (e.g. pencil for edit / bin for delete)
- Improve responsiveness of dashboard once all UI features implemented
- Find a styled calendar component for date input?
- NEXT STEPS:
- Add an "assessments" feature: input pupils and assessment scores and get a graph from D3
- Do a Jest/Vitest/Cypress course for testing and learn more about how to use middleware
