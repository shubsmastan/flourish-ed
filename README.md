<!-- ## Next Steps/Ideas

- Edit class name/user details?
- Modal for adding/editing lessons instead of inline
- Improve appearance of lessons on page + responsiveness of dashboard
- Convert date from string to Date object and use calendar to input (date lib?)
- Correctly use filters on top of class list to show specific lesons
- Have filters on top of class page to filter by week/half-term/term?
- OR: only see future lessons (button to filter past lessons)?
- Have a page for termly/yearly outline -->
